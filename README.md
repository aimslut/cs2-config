# aimslut's cs2 config
<sub> due to valve heavily removing a bunch of commands, it's currently a stripped down version of my old config. </sub>

## Installation
1. Click the green "Code" button in the top right, choose "Download ZIP"
2. Place it in your CFG folder 
   - `SteamApps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/game/csgo/cfg/`
3. Add these launch options to csgo, and change where necessary 
   - `-noborder -w 2560 -h 1440 -high -novid -console -refresh 360 -nojoy +exec aimslut.cfg`
4. I recommend going into `aimslut/user_settings.cfg` and changing to whatever you use
5. Done! B)

ps. if you ever get confused in-game, you can type `cfg_help` :-)
